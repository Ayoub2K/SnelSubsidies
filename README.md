# SubsidieRadar Project
This project is part of an assignment for the
course Innovation (INNO) at the
Hogeschool Utrecht, University of Applied Sciences.


## Starter project
This starter project contains the following:

* A Maven-based setup with several
  third-party libraries and frameworks (see: `pom.xml`)
* A preconfigured Spring project

## Prerequisites
Although it is recommended to always use the latest stable version
of Java, this project requires a version of Java 17 or higher.
You can customize this in your compilation settings and `pom.xml`.

For [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html),
you can use your IDE, install it [globally](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi),
or use the supplied `mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd`.


## Booting
First, make sure the database is set up, started and reachable.

Start the application via your IDE by running the `SubsidieRadarApplication`
class. Alternatively, run `mvn spring-boot:start`.
